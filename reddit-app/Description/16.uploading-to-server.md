# Uploading to a Server:

There are lots of ways to host your HTML and JavaScript. For this demo, we’re going to use the easiest way possible - now // link: https://zeit.co/now
main url: https://zeit.co/home

##### If you don’t want to use now , you’re free to use whatever method you want. For instance, you can host sites on Heroku, AWS S3, upload files to your own server via FTP, etc.

##### The important thing is that the server exposes all of the files in our dist folder onto the internet.

### Installing now.

We can install now with command:

npm install -g now

##### Now we can easily deploy a site with 'now':

First change the folder to dist/reddit-app / name of our application with command:

cd dist/reddit-app

than execute it by simple:
now - command
than we need to enter our e-mail if we have account if not we can easily create the account in zeit under the link displayed in terminal, after confirming e-mail we can run 'now' command again.
