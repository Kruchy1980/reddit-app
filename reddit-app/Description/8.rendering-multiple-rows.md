# Rendering multiple rows

Right now we only have one article on the page and there’s no way to render more,
unless we paste another <app-article> tag. And even if we did that all the articles
would have the same content, so it wouldn’t be very interesting.

### To make it more interesting than now we can create an Article class.

A good practice when writing Angular code is to ry to isolate the data structures we are using from the component code. To do this we should create a data structure that will represent a single artile.
