# Adding the article component.
Firstly we have to create the form to add article bun now is time to create the display for the article list by singular articles.
For that we need to create new component to represent the induvidual submited articles.
For creating component ler's use the ng tools in command line:

ng generate component new-article

### We have three parts to defining this new component:
1. Define the ArticleComponent view in the template
2. Define the ArticleComponent properties by annotating the class with @Compo-
nent
3. Define a component - definition class (ArticleComponent) which houses our component logic.
