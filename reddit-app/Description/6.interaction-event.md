# How to add interaction event

We tell Angular we want to respond to an event by surrounding the event name i in parentheses.

##### example app.component.html

To add a function call to the <button /> onClick event w can pas it through like below:

<form action="" class="ui large form segment">
  <h3 class="ui header">Add a Link</h3>
  <div class="field">
    <label for="title">title</label>
    <input type="text" id="title" />
  </div>
  <div class="field">
    <label for="link">Link</label>
    <input type="text" name="link" id="link" />
  </div>
    <!-- here we can add the button inside form -->
  <button
    (click)="addArticcle(newtitle, newlink)"
    class="ui positive right floted button"
  >
    Submit link
  </button>
</form>

### Now, when the button i clicked, it will call a function called addArticle(), which we need to define on the AppComponent class as below:

### app.component.ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core'

@Component({
selector: 'app-root',
templateUrl: './app.component.html',
styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
<!-- We are adding the class component -->
export class AppComponent {
    <!-- addArticle function includes title and link both are input elements when we can insert the article title and link to the article -->
    addArticle(title: HTMLInputElement, link: HTMLInputElement): boolean {
    <!-- // log just to check if button is working -->
    console.log(`Adding article title: ${title.value} and link: ${link.value}`);
    <!-- if there is nothing in inputs than do nothing -->
    return false;
    }
}

### But if we want it will work than we need to change the template a little bit.

##### app.component.html

<form action="" class="ui large form segment">
  <h3 class="ui header">Add a Link</h3>
  <div class="field">
    <label for="title">title</label>
    <!-- In the inputs we are using the '#' to tell Angular to assign those tags to a local variable. By adding the  %newtitle and #newlink to the appropriate input elements, we can pass them as variables into the addArticle() function on the button  -->
    <input type="title" id="title" #newtitle/> <!-- changed #newtitle added-->
  </div>
  <div class="field">
    <label for="link">Link</label>
    <input type="text" name="link" id="link" #newlink /> <!-- changed - #newlink added-->
  </div>
  <!-- This is the button added with seamntic ui classes-->
  <button
    (click)="addArticle(newtitle, newlink)"
    class="ui violet inverted right floated button"
  >
    Submit link
  </button>
</form>

##### To recap what we’ve done, we’ve made four changes:
1. Created a button tag in our markup that shows the user where to click
2. We created a function named addArticle that defines what we want to do when
the button is clicked
3. We added a (click) attribute on the button that says “call the function
addArticle when this button is pressed”.
4. We added the attribute #newtitle and #newlink to the <input> tags

##### Where the bindings come from:

1. addArticle is a function on our component definition class AppComponent
2. newtitle comes from the resolve ( #newtitle ) on our <input> tag named title
3. newlink comes from the resolve ( #newlink ) on our <input> tag named link


### Notice that:
On our class AppComponent we define a new function called addArticle . It takes two arguments: title and link . Again,it’s important to realize that title and link are both objects of type HTMLInputElement and not the input values directly. To get the value from the input we have to call title.value.
