# Configuring the ArticleComponent with inputs

Now that we have a list of Article models, how can we pass them to our Article-Component component?

Here again we use Input s. Previously we had our ArticleComponent class defined
like this:

### new-article-component-ts:

export class NewArticleComponent implements OnInit {
@HostBinding("attr.class")
cssClass = "row";
newArticle: NewArticle;

<!-- // constructor creates the class we need -->
constructor() {
<!-- //This class constructor does not need the reference to titlen link and votes as well so we will throw it out
// We need to declare what newArticle wshold have insteat of pure title, link and votes -->
this.newArticle = new NewArticle("Angular", "http://angular.io", 10);
}

##### But the problem is that we want not to incapsulate it onlu but also reuse the particular Article

##### What we would really like to do is to configure the Article we want to display. If, for instance, we had two articles, article1 and article2 , we would like to be able to reuse the app-article component by passing an Article as a “parameter” to the component like this:

<app-article [article]="article1"></app-article>
<app-article [article]="article2"></app-article>
### Angular allows us to do this by using Input decorator on  a property of a Component eg:

class ArticleComponent {
    #Input() newArticle: NewArticle;
    ... 
}
### And if we will have out article under variable we could pass it to our Article component in an element by surrounding it in sauare brackets [variableName], like so:

<app-article [article]="myArticle"></app-article>


##### Notice the syntax here: we put the name of the input in brackets as in: [article] and the value of the attribute is what we want to pass into that input.
##### Then, and this is important, the this.article on the ArticleComponent instance will be set to myArticle . We can think about the variable myArticle as being passed as a parameter (i.e. input) to our components.
##### Here’s what our ArticleComponent component now looks like using @Input:

### new-article-comoponent.ts:

import { Component, OnInit, Input, HostBinding } from "@angular/core";
import { ThrowStmt } from "@angular/compiler";
// Here we are importing the class
import { NewArticle } from "./new-article.model";

@Component({
  selector: "app-new-article",
  templateUrl: "./new-article.component.html",
  styleUrls: ["./new-article.component.css"]
})
export class NewArticleComponent implements OnInit {
  @HostBinding("attr.class")
  cssClass = "row";
  @Input() newArticle: NewArticle;


  constructor() {
<!-- // Article is populated by the Input now, so we do not need anything here now
    // this.newArticle = new NewArticle("Angular", "http://angular.io", 10); -->
  }
  <!-- // declaring logic to votes change -->
  voteUp(): boolean {
    this.newArticle.votes += 1;
    return false;
  }

  voteDown(): boolean {
    this.newArticle.votes -= 1;
    return false;
  }

  ngOnInit() {}
}

# ATTENTION !!!
##### Don’t forget to import !
Notice that we import the Input class from @angular/core . We’ve also imported our Article model as we did with the AppComponent earlier.
