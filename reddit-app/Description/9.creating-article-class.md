# Creating article class

To do this we need to add new-article.model.ts and create the code inside the file as below:

### new-article.model.ts

import { NewArticleComponent } from './new-article.component';

// Firstly exporting class of article with previous State NOTE!! that it is not extension of Angular componnent but a plain class.
export class Article {
title: string;
link: string;
votes: number;

// and now we can construct the class as it should be - first declaration of state inside consttuctor
// The question mark means that it is optional not obligatory element
constructor(title: string, link: string, votes?: number) {
this.title = title;
this.link = link;
this.votes = votes || 0;
}
}

### Now we can update the NewArticleComponent code to our new Article class.Instead of storing the properties directlu on the ArticleComponent component let's store the properties on an instance of The Article class

##### Firtstly we need to import the class new-article.component.ts

import { Article } from "./new-article.model";

##### Tham we czn use it new-article.component.ts

@Component({
selector: "app-new-article",
templateUrl: "./new-article.component.html",
styleUrls: ["./new-article.component.css"]
})
export class NewArticleComponent implements OnInit {

<!-- // first declaring properties - 4 of them. -->

@HostBinding("attr.class")
cssClass = "row";

<!-- //here we are adding the article -->

article: NewArticle;

<!-- // These 3 lines are not necessery at present becuse as we remember we have the informations inside our class model
// votes: number;
// title: string;
// link: string; -->

<!-- // constructor creates the class we need -->

constructor() {

<!-- //This class constructor does not need the reference to titlen link and votes as well so we will throw it out -->

<!-- We need to declare what newArticle wshold have insteat of pure title, link and votes -->

this.newArticle = new NewArticle("Angular", "http://angular.io", 10);
}

<!-- // declaring logic to votes change -->

voteUp(): boolean {

<!-- // here we need to add article votes to this not votes only as was b4 -->
<!-- // this.votes += 1; -->

this.article.votes += 1;
return false;
}

voteDown(): boolean {

<!-- // this.votes -= 1; / the same thing in here -->

this.article.votes -= 1;
return false;
}

ngOnInit() {}
}

### Now we need to change some stuff in our new-article.component.html.

##### Notice what we’ve changed: instead of storing the title , link , and votes properties directly on the component, we’re storing a reference to an article . What’s neat is that we’ve defined the type of article to be our new Article class.

##### When it comes to voteUp (and voteDown ), we don’t increment votes on the component, but rather, we need to increment the votes on the article.

##### However, this refactoring introduces another change: we need to update our view to get the template variables from the right location. To do that, we need to change our template tags to read from article . That is, where before we had {{ votes }}, we need to change it to {{ article.votes }}, as same as title and link

## new-article.comopnent.html

<!-- This is one column of article part with votes -->
<div class="four wide column center aligned votes">
  <div class="ui statistic">
    <!-- votes are showed by template expansion strings -->
    <!-- Here we are changing votes for article votes -->
    <!-- <div class="value">{{ votes }}</div> -->
    <div class="value">{{ newArticle.votes }}</div>
    <div class="label">Points</div>
  </div>
</div>
<!-- This is an article information column -->
<div class="eight wide column hr">
  <!-- title is showed by template expansion strings as well -->
  <!-- Here the same thing we are doing with link and title -->
  <!-- <a class="ui large header" href="{{ link }}">{{ title }}</a> -->
  <a class="ui large header" href="{{ newArticle.link }}">{{
    newArticle.title
  }}</a>

  <ul class="ui big horizontal list voters">
    <li class="item">
      <a href (click)="voteUp()"> <i class="arrow up icon"></i>upvote</a>
    </li>
    <li class="item">
      <a href (click)="voteDown()"><i class="arrow down icon"></i>downvote</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

### Now everything should looks alright but...

##### This situation is better but something in our code is still off: our voteUp and voteDown methods break the encapsulation of the Article class by changing the article’s internal properties directly.

##### voteUp and voteDown currently break the Law of Demeter21 which says that a given object should assume as little as possible about the structure or properties of other objects.

##### The problem is that our ArticleComponent component knows too much about the Article class internals. To fix that, let’s add voteUp and voteDown methods on the Article class (we’ll also add a domain function, which we’ll talk about in a moment):

### new-article.models.ts:

import { NewArticleComponent } from "./new-article.component";

<!-- // Firstly exporting class of article with previous State NOTE!! that it is not extension of Angular componnent but a plain class. -->

export class NewArticle {
title: string;
link: string;
votes: number;

<!-- // and now we can construct the class as it should be - first declaration of state inside consttuctor
// The question mark means that it is optional not obligatory element -->

constructor(title: string, link: string, votes?: number) {
this.title = title;
this.link = link;
this.votes = votes || 0;
}

<!-- // we need to transfer this two functions inside article module: -->

voteUp(): void {
this.votes += 1;
}

voteDown(): void {
this.votes -= 1;
}

<!-- // And we need to add domain() methode as well
// domain() is a utility function that extracts
// the domain from a URL, which we'll explain shortly -->

domain(): string {
try {

<!-- // e.g. http://foo.com/path/to/bar -->

const domainAndPath: string = this.link.split("//")[1];

<!-- // e.g. foo.com/path/to/bar -->

return domainAndPath.split("/")[0];
} catch (err) {
return null;
}
}
}

### Now we czn change NewArticleComponent to call these methods new-aarticle-component.ts:

export class NewArticleComponent implements OnInit {
@HostBinding("attr.class")
cssClass = "row";
newArticle: NewArticle;

<!-- // constructor creates the class we need -->

constructor() {

<!-- //This class constructor does not need the reference to titlen link and votes as well so we will throw it out -->
<!-- // We need to declare what newArticle wshold have insteat of pure title, link and votes -->

this.newArticle = new NewArticle("Angular", "http://angular.io", 10);
}

<!-- // declaring logic to votes change -->

voteUp(): boolean {
this.newArticle.votes += 1;
return false;
}

voteDown(): boolean {
this.newArticle.votes -= 1;
return false;
}

ngOnInit() {}
}

### Why do we have a voteUp function in both the model and the compo-

nent?

##### The reason we have a voteUp() and a voteDown() on both classes is because each function does a slightly different thing. The idea is that the voteUp() on the ArticleComponent relates to the component view, whereas the Article model voteUp() defines what mutations happen in the model.

##### That is, it allows the Article class to encapsulate what functionality should happen to a model when voting happens. In a “real” app, the internals of the Article model would probably be more complicated, e.g. make an API request to a webserver, and you wouldn’t want to have that sort of model-specific code in your component controller.

##### Similarly, in the ArticleComponent we return false; as a way to say “don’t propagate the event” - this is a view-specific piece of logic and we shouldn’t allow the Article model’s voteUp() function to have to knowledge about that sort of view-specific API. That is, the Article model should allow voting apart from the specific view.
